# A-Simplified-NIST-RBAC-System
Write a Java program to implement a simplified NIST RBAC model. (The topology and examples here are provided for you to test your program. The instructor will use similar but different test cases to test your program.) 1. Data structures: it is up to you to choose appropriate data structures to maintain role hierarchy, user-role matrix, role-object matrix, etc. 2. Role Hierarchy: this program must support role hierarchy defined in NIST RBAC. 2.1 This program reads a role hierarchy from file “roleHierarchy.txt”. Each line in this file is formatted as “&lt;ascendant> &lt;descendant>”, in which a tab (‘\t’) is the separator in between. For example, for the role hierarchy on the right, the first several lines in roleHiearchy.txt is R8 R6 R9 R7 R10 R7
